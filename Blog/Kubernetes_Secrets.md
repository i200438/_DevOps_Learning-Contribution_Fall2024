# Overview
Kubernetes Secrets provide a secure way to manage sensitive data such as API keys and passwords in containerized applications. They are critical for protecting confidential information and keeping it separate from application code.

# Key Highlights
- Security: Secrets protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
- Access: Secrets can be accessed through environment variables or mounted volumes in Kubernetes Pods.
- Best Practices: Include using RBAC for access control, rotating secrets, and using secret management tools.

# Relevance to DevOps
Kubernetes Secrets ensure secure handling of sensitive information, a critical aspect of DevOps practices. They help streamline secure configurations, automation, and efficient deployment in a containerized environment.
